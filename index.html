    <h1>What is DOM? üòç</h1>
    <p>
      DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for web documents, which provides a structured
      representation of the HTML or XML document. The DOM represents the page so that programs can change the document
      structure, style, and content. The DOM is commonly used with scripting languages like JavaScript to manipulate the
      content and behavior of web pages dynamically.
      <br>
      In simpler terms, the DOM is the way in which web browsers organize and represent web pages internally. It allows
      developers to access and manipulate the various elements of a web page, such as text, images, forms, and links,
      using scripting languages like JavaScript.
